# More tasks that can be done

## At the end of the flask tutorial there are some ideas of things to improve.

### The ones that are crossed out I have already done, the rest I still want to do for learning.

1. A detail view to show a single post. Click a postâ€™s title to go to its page.
1. Like / unlike a post.
1. Comments.
1. Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.
1. A search box that filters the index page by name.
1. Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.
1. Upload an image to go along with a post.
1. Format posts using Markdown.
1. An RSS feed of new posts.
